#   With suggests in the documents and also what we studied for the algorithms of several search functions, we decided
# to extract a main method for all other search methods. For the better reuse and understandability.
#   Method description: With the format information of problem.getStartState() == (5,5),
# problem.isGoalState(problem.getStartState()) == False, and problem.getSuccessors(problem.getStartState()) ==
# [((5, 4), 'South', 1), ((4, 5), 'West', 1)]
# path_to_goal == ['West', 'West', 'West', 'West', 'South', 'South', 'East', 'South', 'South', 'West']
#   We push the general search as the format below and make a list to make sure each coordinate is visited or not.
#   Make a loop with condition of if the algorithm is not empty, then keep running
#   pop()(remove) coordinate and move to the next, and set the current_state
#   If goal state == True for current state, run a roop in the path finding, if x[1] data not empty,  add x[1] to
# path_to_goal.
# Else will check whether the current_state is visited, if not, add to visited.
# Later on, run the roop for successor states for current_state, and add each successtors for current state.
# Last step, push the succesor paths to the algorithm.
